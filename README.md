- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Azeem.
First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in c++ and make it to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve a practical problem. Software engineer is a never ending puzzle that I passionately engaged in solving.I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me.
